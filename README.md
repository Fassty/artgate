## Installation

Only thing you really need is Python (3.8 or 3.9) and the `Kivy` library installed

On Windows you can install the library as:
```
python -m pip install kivy
```

or if you are using Anaconda
```
conda install kivy -c conda-forge
```

Then you can just clone the repo by:
```
git clone git@github.com:Fassty/artgate.git
```

and start coding. :]
